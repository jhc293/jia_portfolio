        Welcome to my anime page! Over here, you’ll be able to see a comprehensive list of my top nine favorite anime of all time! 
        Anime are japanese illustrations of animation typically voiced in Japanese, but can also be found dubbed in local languages or 
        be in other languages subtitles with the original japanese voices. For the best experience, it is best to watch anime in its 
        original japanese voices with your local language subtitles. I hope that after reading this list, you give one, if not all of 
        the anime a try!

            <h1>Kill La Kill</h1>
            <p>
                This is one of my favorite anime of all time.
                Kotaku calls it “Kill la Kill is a rare breed of anime. It perfectly mixes comedy and action while reveling in taking everything to the extreme. And the fact that it has now ended leaves each week looking a little less bright.” 
                From the fight scenes, to the hyperactive and fast paced plot, you’ll find something you’ll love in this show!

            <h1>One Piece</h1>
            <p>
                Infamously known for one of the longest running mainstream anime, 
                One piece has a lovely and heartwarming story as the Strawhat pirates lead by Monkey D. Luffy 
                set sail to find the One Piece treasure. The characters have great development, tears will be shed, and 
                tears of joy will also be shed. The action in this show is incredible and has strong comedic elements. 
                No wonder this anime has aired for over 20 years since its debut in 1999.

                chosen by the world’s greatest hero, all might, to inherit his quirk! He attends ua high, the most prestigious

            <h1>The God of High School</h1>
            <p>
                This show is technically not an anime but an animated manhwa meaning that it has korean animation origins. 
                However, for our purposes they are the same. The God of High school has the best fight scenes out of all anime 
                I’ve watched here. In this tournament style anime follow the trio: Yu-Mira, Hon- DaeWi, and Jin Mori; as they 
                embark on their quest to see who will reign supreme in the God of High School Tournament. As far as plot goes 
                for this story, it is a little confusing for a short series (13 episodes) but enjoyable nontheless!

                Eighth-grader Shigeo "Mob" Kageyama has tapped into his inner wellspring of psychic 
                prowess at a young age. But the power quickly proves to be a liability when he realizes 
                the potential danger in his skills. Choosing to suppress his power, Mob's only present use 
                for his ability is to impress his longtime crush, Tsubomi, who soon grows bored of the same tricks.
                In order to effectuate control on his skills, Mob enlists himself under the wing of 
                Arataka Reigen, a con artist claiming to be a psychic, who exploits Mob's powers for 
                pocket change. Now, exorcising evil spirits on command has become a part of Mob's daily, 
                monotonous life. (My Animelist) Plot: 10/10 Fights: 10/10

                a Titan brings about the destruction of his hometown and the death of his mother. 
                This show will bring tingles down your spine. This action packed, thriller-esque 
                anime has a huge fan base. After giving this soon to be 5 season anime a watch, 
                you would probably be part of that same fanbase.

                In times of need, if you look in the right place, you just may see a strange
                 telephone number scrawled in red. If you call this number, you will hear a young 
                 man introduce himself as the Yato God. Yato is a minor deity and a self-proclaimed 
                 "Delivery God," who dreams of having millions of worshippers. Without a single shrine 
                 dedicated to his name, however, his goals are far from being realized. He spends his 
                 days doing odd jobs for five yen apiece, until his weapon partner becomes fed up with 
                 her useless master and deserts him. Just as things seem to be looking grim for the god, 
                 his fortune changes when a middle school girl, Hiyori Iki, supposedly saves Yato from a 
                 car accident, taking the hit for him.
